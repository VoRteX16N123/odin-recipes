    <h2>Garlic Fried Chicken</h2>

    <p>This actually uses my breading for Chicken Fried Steak---my husband suggested we try it with chicken breasts, and it was delicious!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste</li>
        
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        
        <li>½ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        
        <li>1 egg</li>
       
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded thin</li>
        
        <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a shallow dish, mix together the garlic powder, pepper, salt, paprika, bread crumbs and flour.<br> In a separate dish, whisk together the milk and egg.
        
        <li>Heat the oil in an electric skillet set to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).<br> Dip the chicken into the egg and milk, then dredge in the dry ingredients until evenly coated.
        
        <li>Fry chicken in the hot oil for about 5 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.<br> Remove from the oil with a slotted spatula, and serve.</li>

    </ol>
